HTML

html - all tags needs to go inside of this, it's the root of any document
head - This is where you put accessory things that you need to load
    before the rest of the page. This would include styles, for example.
body - Anything you put in here will be visible by people viewing your page

h1 - heading 1 - the biggest title you have on your page
h2, h3 - you can also make smaller titles using these

ul - unordered list. Fill this with <li> tags.

li - li items - these will usually appear as a bulleted lists unless
  you use CSS to style them


<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
  - links a stylesheet called 'styles.css' to the webpage. Put this inside your head tags

<script src="script.js"> </script>
  - adds a Javascript script called script.js to your page. You
   usually put these inside the head tag too, but if your JavaScript
   talks to your HTML elements (e.g. to create <li> elements), then you should
   put this right at the end of your body.


input - this provides a small box for you to type things into.
  It takes a single attribute called type, like this
  <input type="text"></input>

img - puts an image on your page. Takes an attribute called 'src', like this:
  <img src="myImage.jpg">
